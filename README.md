# IngrAIdients

![Alt text](Images/Illustration.png)
IngrAIdients will feature an app interface where users can take a photo and receive a list of ingredients on their phone. At its core, the system will use a supervised deep learning algorithm trained on pairs of dish images and ingredient lists. It will incorporate a CNN for input image feature extraction and a transformer model for generating natural language text output.
